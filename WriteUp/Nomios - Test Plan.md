# Nomios - Test Plan

For any application it is important to test it in order to make sure that it meets its specified objectives and that it can catch and deal with any unexpected errors to prevent the application from halting. Therefore, my tests should test the application to ensure that the objectives are met and test the application using extreme, expected and erroneous data to ensure that the application can handle errors correctly.

My program is a website and therefore is run in a web browser. In order to serve the majority of users I must therefore serve those web browsers that the majority of users use. I selected the top three web browsers ordered by market share by calculating a mean average of the figures presented by [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers) Wikipedia page. The top three web browsers in order of highest market share are:

1. Google Chrome at 50.1%
2. Safari at 19.3%
3. UC Browser at 8.32%

Combined, these three browsers make up 77.7% of the market share. These browsers therefore serve the majority of users, so to make sure that my testing is valid (by which I mean that most users can actually use the website) I decided to carry one set of tests per browser.

Each test is designed to help prove that each objective listed in my analysis is met

Below are the test that I will conduct. Remember, each of these tests will be repeated for each browser to make sure that my test is valid for the majority of users and that all for these tests are conducted within the website user interface, rather than any other interface that works with a database (such as a *PHPMyAdmin* - a popular web interface for MySQL databases).

Below are some definitions specific to this document. All other definitions that are related to this document can be found in my Analysis and Documented Design Documents. Note that the *Reference Number* is in hexadecimal and that each number is a key for a particular screenshot in the *Test Results* file. Evidence that a test was successful or unsuccessful will also be entered into this file with he evidence being in the form of screenshots. Each screenshot will also have attatched a short peice of text explaining what the results mean and wheteher or not they satisfy the expected result.

> A **thread** is the set of messages based around a particular topic or question in a forum.
>
> A **message** is a response to the original post that started the thread.
>
> A **reply** is a response to a message within a thread.
>
> **Test** data consists of *extreme* (very ends of the range of acceptable values for an input), *expected* (a typical value to be accepted in an input) and *erroneous* (unexpected and invalid value for an input) data that together work to test the effectiveness of the catching of errors in a program.
>
> A **proto-oncogene** is a normal gene that has mutated and now has the potential to cause a cancerous tumour.
>
> A **sequence** is a DNA sequence associated with a histone modification sequence that alter the expression of the DNA sequence.

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Start a thread.                                              | Checks if a thread start message can be successfully added to the database. | A record is added to the *threads* table.                    | 0                |
| Post a message.                                              | Checks if a message can be successfully added to the database. | A record is added to the *messages* table.                   | 1                |
| Post a reply.                                                | Checks if a reply can be successfully added to the database. | A record is added to the *replies* table.                    | 2                |
| View a thread from another user.                             | Checks if a user can view posts by another user. If successful than a user can communicate with other users. | The thread of another user is displayed.                     | 3                |
| Post a message in response to another user's start thread.   | Confirms that one user can communicate with another within the forum. | A record is added to the *messages* table.                   | 4                |
| Post a message   using HTML mark-up.                         | To make sure that HTML mark-up is filtered out to prevent a XSS attack, such as UI distortion. | The HTML mark-up is removed from the text before it is submitted to the database. | 5                |
| Use an admin user to delete a reply.                         | Confirms that an admin can remove replies within a thread, including inappropriate ones. | A row is deleted from the *replies* table.                   | 6                |
| Attempt to use a standard user to delete a reply, message or thread. | Confirms that a non-admin user cannot delete their own data within the forum. | The user fails to delete messages, replies and threads from the database . | 7                |
| Post a reply, message and thread to the forum that includes stylised text. | This checks to see if the program-defined mark-up is working. This mark-up stylises and structures the text to make it more readable and emphatic. | A reply, message and thread row are added to the *replies*, *messages* and *threads* tables respectively. The text can then be viewed as being styled. | 8                |
| Ensure that the website, including the text designed to help the user to use the website is correctly displayed. | This checks the user interface, to make sure it is correctly interpreted and therefore displayed by the browser. This ensure that the majority of users can successfully navigate and use the website including through the use of the help text. | The HTML mark-up and CSS is interpreted correctly and displayed as intended. | 9                |
| Create a new user account.                                   | This makes sure that a user can own their own account and therefore, have their own data attributed to it. | A new record is inserted to the *users* table.               | A                |
| Attempt to create a new reply, message, thread, sequence and disease when not signed into an account. | This ensures that a user can only have their data attributed to their account by preventing any sort of data submission (besides the creation of a new account) without being signed into an account. | The user fails to submit any new data to the database.       | B                |
| Create a new disease.                                        | Checks if a disease can be created and submitted to the database. Also checks to see if a unique name is checked for when creating a *disease* record so that it can be differentiated from others. | A new record is inserted into the *disease* table with a unique *name* attribute. | C                |
| Create a new sequence.                                       | Checks if a sequence can be created and submitted to a database by breaking it down into chunks called *nucleosomes* and storing the sequence as a relationship between these nucleosomes. Each nucleosome also has an associated DNA sequence which is check to be stored successfully in the database too. Also checks to see if a unique name is checked for when creating a *nucelosomesequence* record so that it can be differentiated from others. | New records are inserted into the *nucleosome*, *nucelosomesequence* and *nucleosomednasequence* tables. With the new *nucelosomesequence* record having a unique *name* attribute relative to the user. | D                |
| Attribute the sequence to the disease. Then check if it is displayed as part of the disease. | Checks if a relationship between a disease and a sequence can be created and is successfully recognised by the program. | A change to the *nucelosomesequence* record is detected and is subsequently displayed when viewing the sequences specific to a particular disease. | E                |
| Create another sequence and attribute it to the same disease as previously using another users' account. | Confirms that users can collaborate with each other to work on a set of sequences that are attributed to the same disease. | Both sequences are listed under the same disease, and each can be viewed by the same user. | F                |
| Add a new nucleosome to the sequence using the same user account that created the sequence. | Confirms that a sequence can have new data added to it. It aids the confirmation that the user that created the sequence can edit it. | A new record is added to the *nucleosome* table and can be viewed within the page for a specific sequence. | 11               |
| Edit the histone sequence and DNA sequence for a specific nucleosome using the same user account that created the sequence. | This confirms that a nucleosome (and therefore an entire sequence) can be edited by replacing old data with new data. It also confirms that a DNA sequence and histone sequence can be edited by a user. It aids the confirmation that the user that created the sequence can edit it. | A record in the *nucleosome* table is updated. The changes can be viewed within the page for a specific sequence. | 12               |
| Delete a nucleosome and a sequence from the database using the same user account that created the sequence. | This confirms that a sequence can have data removed from it (i.e. a nucleosome). It aids the confirmation that the user that created the sequence can edit it. | A record from the *nucleosome* table is removed and its absence noted by the user when reading the sequence's display page. The specified record from *nucelsomeseqence* is removed. All records associated with that *nucelosomesequence* record are also removed. | 13               |
| Perform the previous three tests using a different account to that which was used to create the sequence. | This will confirm that only the user that creates a sequence can edit it, and that any other users cannot. Therefore preventing malicious attacks between users. | The user fails to update, add or delete any data in the database. | 14               |
| Edit the *notes* section of a disease and a sequence.        | This will confirm that a user can add a description or note any important information on a particular disease or sequence. | The *notes* attribute of a disease record and a sequence record are both updated in the *disease* and *nucelosomesequence* tables respectively. | 15               |
| Interpret a sequence that uses a proto-oncogene that when paired with activator histone modifications causes the risk of cancer to increase. | This will confirm that a result is produced and presented to the user after a sequence is interpreted. It will also confirm that the interpreter is accurate if the result matches the expected outcome by using this real-life example. | A positive result is displayed to the user in the form of a positive integer, denoting an increase in expression. | 16               |
| Interpret a sequence that uses a proto-oncogene that when paired with repressive histone modifications causes the risk of cancer to decrease. | This will confirm that a result is produced and presented to the user after a sequence is interpreted. It will also confirm that the interpreter is accurate if the result matches the expected outcome by using this real-life example. | A negative result is displayed to the user in the form of a negative integer, denoting a decrease in expression. | 17               |
| Interpret a sequence that uses the APP gene that when paired with activator histone modifications causes the progression of Alzheimer's Disease to increase. | This will confirm that a result is produced and presented to the user after a sequence is interpreted. It will also confirm that the interpreter is accurate if the result matches the expected outcome by using this real-life example. | A positive result is displayed to the user in the form of a positive integer, denoting an increase in expression. | 18               |
| Search for a specific sequence and disease that the user has created. | This will confirm that the search function is accurate by returning results specific to what they user has specified. It also confirms that the user can aggregate their sequences and diseases on one page so that they can quickly navigate them. | The sequence and disease searched for is displayed to the user and is owned by the user. | 19               |
| Search for a specific sequence and disease that another user has created. | This will confirm that the search function is accurate by returning results specific to what they user has specified. It also confirms that the user can locate another users' sequence or disease and view it for collaborative purposes. | The sequence and disease searched for is displayed to the user. | 1A               |
| Use an admin user to delete a message.                       | Confirms that an admin can remove messages within a thread, including inappropriate ones. | A row is deleted from the *messages* table and all of the associated *replies* rows are deleted from it too. | 1B               |
| Use an admin user to delete a thread.                        | Confirms that an admin can remove thread within the forum, including inappropriate ones. | A row is deleted from the *thread* table and all of the *message* rows associated with it are delete too, as well as the *replies* rows that are associated with each message. | 1C               |
